   * Indicates whether the effect is allowed to recursively trigger itself
   * when managed by the scheduler.
   *
   * By default, a job cannot trigger itself because some built-in method calls,
   * e.g. Array.prototype.push actually performs reads as well (#1740) which
   * can lead to confusing infinite loops.
   * The allowed cases are component update functions and watch callbacks.
   * Component update functions may update child component props, which in turn
   * trigger flush: "pre" watch callbacks that mutates state that the parent
   * relies on (#1801). Watch callbacks doesn't track its dependencies so if it
   * triggers itself again, it's likely intentional and it is the user's
   * responsibility to perform recursive state mutation that eventually
   * stabilizes (#1727).
